These files contain the t3d files that were used to modify the GMDX maps.

In some cases, additional map notes are documented as .txt files with similar names.

All maps are by default built with the BSP cuts setting at 15 and Optimal cuts.

The maps are based on the GMDX vRSD 2.2 Beta.

The _old folder documents some non-GMDX related changes, such as LDDP NPCs and Augmentique outfit locations. These are mostly for documentation purposes, since the map files themselves already contain these objects.
