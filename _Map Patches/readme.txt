These files contain the t3d files that were used to modify the GMDX maps.

Each one is contained in a folder relevant to it's feature.

In some cases, additional map modification was necessary, which is documented in the t3d files themselves.

The maps are based on the GMDX vRSD 2.2 Beta. This means it should be theoretically possible to recreate them using the maps from the 2.2 Beta, then applying the t3d files, following the instructions inside them carefully.
