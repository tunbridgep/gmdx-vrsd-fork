<P>Dave,

<P>I understand we've all been working hard, but you can't keep ignoring your responsibilities. I know the camera doesn't beep when we're asleep, but that doesn't mean the base commander isn't going to come down here in person one day and find you asleep. If a real attack happens we don't want to be caught off guard because you weren't watching your post.
