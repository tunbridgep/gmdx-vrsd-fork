<P>Frank,
<P>
<P>As you spilled coffee all over your computer (idiot), we'll have to do this the old fashioned way: pen and paper.
<P>Your orders are to send out an alert to all posted patrol employees of this sector -- I want all to guard the door leading to sector 3 indefinitely.
<P>The order's come straight from the top, code red, so make sure nobody is slacking off in Rec.
<P>We've an assault team on standby ready to react to the first alarm call, but if any assailants make it this far into the base don't expect to even see them coming, so assemble the troops and make sure they're prepared.
<P>
<P>F. Barose,
<P>Chief Security Officer
