<P>TAKEDOWNS
<P>
<P>Perform a takedown! To do so, equip a melee weapon, sneak right up behind the hologram and aim for the midsection or the back of the head, then press 'Fire Weapon' (default = Left Mouse Button).
<P>
<P>The Baton or Riot Prod are best suited to this task as a result of their silent and non-lethal nature, though any weapon can be used.
<P>
<P>A takedown can only be performed if the target is unaware of your presence.
