<P>DOOR INTERACTIVITY
<P>
<P>Doors that can be interacted with will display relevant information before your eyes (via your HUD augmentation):
<P>
<P>Lock Complexity: complexity of the lock (if any); the number of lockpicks required to pick the lock.
<P>Door Durability: a representation of door sturdiness, simplified as a 'health bar'.
<P>Damage Threshold: if your weapon does not deal greater damage than this number you will not be able to break the door with that weapon.
<P>
<P>See if you can bypass all three doors.
