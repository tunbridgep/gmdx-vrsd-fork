Give Me Deus Ex: Augmented Edition
===============================

Give Me Deus Ex is a large-scale Deus Ex Advancement Mod, which builds upon Deus Ex's core gameplay whilst strictly adhering to the design principles of Ion Storm.
GMDX Reinforces all aspects of the game to varying degrees except the plot/writing.

GMDX: Augmented Edition is an expansive overhaul of the original GMDX mod fixing many bugs, adding new gameplay systems, and adding a ton of quality of life features,
all while staying true to the design principles of Ion Storm and the previous versions of GMDX.

GMDX: AE has been made with significant input and feedback from previous GMDX developers, and has been created with care to ensure it fits within the established
vision, design goals, and overall style of GMDX.

||  GMDX AE INSTALLATION GUIDE:                                             ||
||--------------------------------------------------------------------------||

|||Getting Deus Ex mod-ready|||

1. Install Deus Ex.
2. Launch Deus Ex and press ESC to enable the main menu. At the main menu look for the text "v1.112fm" at the bottom.
If "v1.112fm" is NOT displayed or the version number is different, please apply the Official patch v1.112fm.

The easiest way to acquire the v1.112fm patch is to install the Game of the Year Edition.

The GOTY edition can be purchased from Steam, GOG, and other retailers.

|||Installing GMDX: AE|||

1. Download the GMDX: AE Installer.
    - The installer comes in two versions: Full and Lite.
    - The only difference between the versions is that the Full version also comes with HDTP and New Vision.
    - Existing installations of HDTP and New Vision may be used instead of the Full version.
2. Launch the GMDX AE setup and follow the necessary steps to install the mod.

The installer should automatically detect your Deus Ex installation.

If it does not, please ensure you install to a valid Deus Ex directory.

GMDX: AE must be installed to your *base* Deus Ex directory, not the System Folder.

|||Running GMDX: AE|||

GMDX: AE comes with Kenties Deus Exe (more information can be found here: https://kentie.net/article/dxguide/)

The GMDX: AE installer will create a new file, *GMDX_AE.exe*, which can be used as an easy one-click way to enjoy the mod.

To launch GMDX: AE through steam, please add the following to the Launch Parameters of Deus Ex GOTY:

"C:\Program Files\Steam\steamapps\common\Deus Ex\System\GMDX_AE.exe" %command%

Be sure to replace the path specified with your actual Deus Ex installation path. This can be found by right-clicking Deus Ex in Steam,
selecting Manage, and then selecting Browse Local Files.

**To ensure the mod is installed correctly, the Main Menu should display the words "Give Me Deus Ex: Augmented Edition" at the bottom.

|||Special Cases and Alternate Launchers|||

**IT IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED THAT YOU RUN THE MOD THROUGH THE DEDICATED EXE FILE. THIS SECTION IS ONLY FOR ADVANCED USERS**

GMDX: AE may also be played without Kenties Deus Exe (or by using alternative launchers), as the GMDX_AE exe will replace the DeusEx.int file automatically.

Additionally, it can be played without the GMDX_AE.exe file at all, which may be desired for users with pre-existing Deus Ex setups with multiple mods already installed.

To get GMDX working without the dedicated exe file, follow these steps:

1. Ensure the GMDX: AE directory is added to DeusEx.ini
2. Ensure that DeusEx.int is copied from the GMDX: AE directory into the base System directory (this is not necessary if using Kenties Deus Exe on Windows)
3. Ensure that UseS3TC is enabled (if not using the DirectX10 Renderer), as the game will crash when using scopes otherwise.
    - GMDX: AE will automatically enable UseS3TC if it's disabled, but may crash once because the setting requires a game restart to take effect.
4. It is recommended that you set your FOV to 100+, as GMDX: AE can account for higher FOVs and adjust weapon models accordingly.

||--------------------------------------------------------------------------||
||  IMPORTANT NOTES:                                                        ||
||--------------------------------------------------------------------------||

GMDX: AE is compatible with the following mods:
- ConFix (Included in all versions, installed automatically, not optional)
- New Vision (Included in Full Version)
- HDTP (Included in Full Version)
- Lay-D Denton Project (Included in all versions)
- Augmentique (Included in all versions)

With the exception of Confix, Each of these mods is optional, but highly recommended.

**GMDX: AE should not be used with Maps Patch, Transcended or any other bugfix/patch mod. GMDX: AE already contains fixed maps and many vanila bugfixes.**

You must start a new game to play GMDX: AE without conflict. Do not use it on an existing savegame!

The `Docs/vRSD_Docs` folder contains the original documentation from previous GMDX versions. It's highly recommended that you read it!

When using GMDX_AE.exe, your configuration and saved games will be saved to "My Documents/Deus Ex/GMDX_AE" (if using Kenties Deus Exe).

||--------------------------------------------------------------------------||
||  FORKS/EDITING/NEW VERSIONS                                              ||
||--------------------------------------------------------------------------||

While GMDX: Augmented Edition itself is a fork of vRSD, which is a fork of GMDX v9, forking should no longer be necessary.

GMDX: AE is hosted on GitHub (https://github.com/tunbridgep/gmdx-vrsd-fork).

**It is highly recommended that you create an issue/pull request rather than forking your own version. Otherwise, there will
be an increasing number of different GMDX versions, which will confuse players and cause other problems.

GMDX: Augmented Edition was created with explicit permission from RoSoDude (creator of the vRSD fork) and Totalitarian (Creator
of the original GMDX Mod). While both of these mods do provide permissive licenses that allow forking, creating forks without permission
could cause issues. It is highly recommended that you create a pull request instead.**

|||Editor Setup|||

If you wish to edit GMDX: AE, the following is required:

1. You must download the Deus Ex Editing Pack (https://www.dxalpha.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=15816) in order to get UnrealEd
2. Update DeusEx.ini to contain the EditPackages from EditPackages.txt
2. Using UnrealEd, go to the Classes dropdown on the right, then click Export All. This will create class files for all Deus Ex code files.

To update code files, navigate to the System folder, open a cmd window and type "del ./DeusEx.u && ./ucc make", which should build the DeusEx.u package.
To rebuild RSDCrap (should not be necessary in most cases), navigate to the System folder, open a cmd window and type "del ./RSDCrap.u && ./ucc make", which should build the RSDCrap.u package.

While it's possible to edit GMDX this way, it's recommended that you use the Git repo instead.

Using the Git repo will give you access to the following additional features:

1. The ability to make pull requests easily from the GitHub website
2. A complete timeline of development history and the ability to checkout previous versions
3. T3D files for revuilding building maps from scratch
4. Other development files used for creating some of the files for the mod, such as PCX files for creating RSDCrap.u and other texture files.

In order to use the code from GitHub, do the following:

1. Clone the GitHub repository to any folder on your hard drive.
2. In your Deus Ex folder, delete the DeusEx/Classes and RSDCrap/Classes folders (these folders contain uc script files, verify that you have the right folders!)
3. Create a symbolic link from your Git Repository _Classes/DeusEx folder to the DeusEx/Classes folder
4. Create a symbolic link from your Git Repository _Classes/RSDCrap folder to the RSDCrap/Classes folder

To create symbolic links, use Link Shell Extension (https://schinagl.priv.at/nt/hardlinkshellext/linkshellextension.html):

1. Install Link Shell Extension
2. While holding right-click, drag and drop the _Classes/DeusEx folder in the cloned git repository to DeusEx/ inside your Deus Ex folder
3. After dragging and dropping, in the context menu that appears, select "Drop As" -> Junction
4. Rename the newly-dropped folder to Classes

If this works correctly, inside your Deus Ex folder you should have:
- A System/ folder, containing DeusEx.exe, UnrealEd.exe, etc
- A DeusEx/Classes/ folder, containing all the uc files from the github repository.

Now you can edit the uc files within the github repository to your hearts content, rebuilding DeusEx.u as much as you want.

If you wish to create symbolic links without using Link Shell Extension, please follow these guides:

|||Editing Maps|||

In most cases, map edits are very straightforward and can be done in UnrealEd easily.

for general UnrealEd guides related to Deus Ex Mapping, consult this website:
http://www.stevetack.com/archive/TacksDeusExLab/

While most map changes are easy to create, the map files are not stored in the git repository, so these changes need to be tracked.

The easiest way to do this is using File/Export Map and replacing the map's T3D file, however adding T3D entries manually is preferred.

|||Rebuilding the Maps From Scratch|||

Sometimes, it's tedious/painful to make large-scale map edits in the editor.

For instance: replacing all of one class type with another is very difficult.

These edits can be done easily using a text editor and editing the t3d files directly.

In these cases, the maps will need to be rebuilt from scratch.

Each of the maps is defined in a t3d file within the github repository, in the _Map Patches directory.

To rebuild a map, perform the following steps:

1. Copy GMDXTestures.utx, GameEffects.utx, KZTextures.utx and Tester.utx from GMDX_AE/Textures into Deus Ex/Textures
2. Copy NavalBaseAlt_Music.umx and UNATCO2_Music.umx from GMDX_AE/Music into Deus Ex/Music
3. Open UnrealEd
4. On the right hand side of the editor, go to "Textures" in the drop down.
5. Click Load
6. Select all utx files in the file browser and click Open
7. On the right hand side of the editor, go to "Music" in the drop down.
8. Select all umx files in the file browser and click Open
7. On the right hand side of the editor, go to "SoundFX" in the drop down.
8. Select all uax files in the file browser and click Open
9. Go to File/Import Level
10. Navigate to your _Map Patches folder and select the relevant t3d file in the file browser and click Open
11. In Import Map Options, ensure "Import a New Map" is selected.
12. Click Import

This will create a wireframe of the map. Modifications to brushes and objects can be made in this view.

When you're ready to build the map, do the following:
1. Go to Options/Rebuild
2. Uncheck "Auto BSP"
3. Click Rebuild Geometry
4. Go to the BSP Tab
5. Set the BSP settings to Optimal and the slider to 15 (see note below!!!!)
6. Uncheck Auto-Lighting
7. Click Rebuild BSP
8. Go to the Lighting tab
9. Click Paths Define
10. Click Apply Lights.

**NOTE: Some map t3d files will come with an accompanying text file explaining which BSP settings to use.
It's important to follow these instructions, otherwise built maps will have BSP errors and other issues!**

**NOTE 2: Some maps will immediately crash UnrealEd upon building or loading. This is because they are too complex to render.
Make sure the editor is in Wireframe mode by clicking the Mode button in the 3d view, and selecting "Map Persp".**
