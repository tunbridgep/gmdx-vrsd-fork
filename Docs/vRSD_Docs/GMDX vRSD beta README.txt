#### ABOUT ####
This is the beta version of the GMDX version RSD fork. Up until now, it was referred to as the RSD addon (placeholder name) as well as version 9.0.4, which was originally going to contain only the bugfixes and QoL updates from the addon. After much discussion, Totalitarian and I agreed that the design changes in the addon were solid and worthwhile, and as such it wasn't worth the effort to maintain two separate branches of GMDX just for its own sake. Moreover, the scope of the project has expanded to the point that it is best considered as a wholly new version of GMDX.
Version RSD is an experimental fork of GMDX v9, with many brand-new features and adjustments to the game, in addition to a large number of bugfixes. Ultimately, the goal is for vRSD to become a suitable release candidate for an official update to GMDX. As such, it will evolve over the course of the beta period as feedback determines which experimental elements from vRSD remain in the final release. In particular, new and reworked augmentations/skills/perks and overhauled systems (such as the new addiction system for drugs) require testing and analysis for their place in GMDX, which has earned its reputation in previous versions for subtly expanding and refining Deus Ex while remaining true to its core design principles. As a new face succeeding the development of such a revered mod for a legendary game, I do not wish to transform GMDX into something unrecognizable, but rather work within Totalitarian's vision for his mod and produce something that new and old fans can appreciate. Please do not hesitate to voice your opinion on the new features and join in the discussion.
Only the English localization is currently updated from version 9, sorry!

### CREDITS AND THANKS ####
For now I'd like to give my utmost thanks to Totalitarian for creating GMDX in the first place, for giving his blessing for my work, for offering all manner of technical support and insightful discussion, for being a mentor and a friend in general, and so on.
Credit goes to Lorenz Rosenthal for the amazing Radial Augmentation Menu addon incorporated here with permission.
Credit goes to Veronika for the D3D10 HDR lighting brightness fix, as well as thanks for DX modding tools and helpful tips.
Credit goes to Markie Music for some new unique sound effects for GMDX
Credit also goes to my "executive tester" Lithium Flower for some updated item descriptions, as well as thanks for testing and conversation which has both increased and decreased my brain cell count (probably a wash either way).
I'd like to especially thank everyone on ModDB who tested the previous beta versions and provided helpful reports and feedback
I'd also like to thank the GMDX Discord and the relevant members of RPGCodex, the SystemShock.org forums, and the Prey Discord for the feedback and continued interest
