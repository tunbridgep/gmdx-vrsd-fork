This is the GMDX v8.0 changelog ONLY. For the vast majority of features in GMDX see: http://genericname112.wix.com/gmdx 

///////---------------------------------------------------------\\\\\\\

                           MISCELLANEOUS

\\\\\\\---------------------------------------------------------///////

Secondary Weapons:

-Assign secondary weapons of your choosing (such as grenades or throwing knives) which can be used without having to change your primary weapon.
-Secondary weapon is assigned via the inventory and used via its own rebindable key. 

Perk System:

-Over 30 new empowering perks.
-Features skill requirements; you must first upgrade the respective skill to the corresponding level to be able to purchase the perk.
-Enables new features such as the ability to toggle grenades that explode on contact or timed, and the ability to hack security systems at range with multitools.
-Click the "perks" button from the skills screen.
-More choice, more depth. How will you build your character?

Expanded Physics:

-Pickups and decorative objects now move when taking damage, meaning explosions send objects flying, and hitting objects or shooting them 
knocks them around.
-Force is transferred when one object hits another.
-AI are knocked back by high-powered weaponry.
-Improved the microfibral muscle object power throw physics.
-Pool ball and basketball physics improved, and various other physics tweaks.

New Stamina system:

-Stamina must be managed. Running out of stamina results in a penalty to movement & jump height for a short period of time. 
-Various RPG upgrades increase total stamina and regeneration rate.
-The stamina system has great impact on a number of systems and results in more tactical and in-depth gameplay.

A vast wealth of new menu options. Here are some samples:

Option 1: Create your own custom color themes for both the HUD and Menus.
Option 2: Real Time UI: if enabled time is not paused while in the inventory/during UI navigation akin to System Shock & Ultima Underworld.
Option 3: if enabled, player death event happens in first person perspective as opposed to third.
Option 4: Toolbelt selection that functions similar to Deus Ex: Invisible War.
Option 5: if enabled, your currently held weapon automatically holsters weapons when attempting to pick up carryable decoration.
Opyion 6: toggle hitmarker on/off. The hitmarker indicates that you hit the target. 

----

Misc Other:

represents how visible you are to enemies. 

Spy drone:

-The Spy Drone now has cloaking (AI never reacted to the spy drone, so this gives good reasoning as to why).

                           LEVEL DESIGN

\\\\\\\---------------------------------------------------------///////

The level design work of GMDX focuses on improving the experience in every respect whilst remaining very faithful to the original design direction of Deus Ex.
