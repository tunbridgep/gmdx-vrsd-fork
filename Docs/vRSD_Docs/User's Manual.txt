A large-scale Deus Ex Advancement Mod, GMDX builds upon Deus Ex whilst strictly adhering to the design principles of Ion Storm.
Reinforces all aspects of the game to varying degrees except the plot/writing.

|||Getting Deus Ex mod-ready|||

1. Install Deus Ex.
2. Launch Deus Ex up to the main menu. At the main menu look for the text "v1.112fm". 
If "v1.112fm" is NOT displayed and some other version number is then apply the Official patch v1.112fm.

|||Installing GMDX|||

1. Download GMDX v9.0
2. Launch GMDXv9_Setup.exe and follow the necessary steps to install the mod.
Install to the Deus Ex directory (C:\DeusEx for example). 
Once installed you MUST launch the game from one of the three Play_GMDX shotcuts. 

Installation complete. You can now play GMDX.

||  IMPORTANT NOTES:                                                        ||
||--------------------------------------------------------------------------||

GMDX is compatible with HDTP and New Vision ONLY. That is, essentially, all you need. 
GMDX is the most comprehensive fix/patch mod available, so you don't need the Deus Ex maps patch or anything like that.

You have to start a new game to begin GMDX without conflict.

Don't set FOV too high (90 is recommended) otherwise HDTP culling is visible on some weapons. 

As indication GMDX is installed properly the main menu will display "GMDXv9.0".

GMDX can be played with ANY official version (including Steam, Retail, GOTY etc) of 
Deus Ex providing it is patched to v1112fm (GOTY version has this patch by default).

Look in DeusEx\GMDX\System and you'll find two configuration files: gmdx.ini & gmdxuser.ini. 
In these files you can configure aspects of DeusEx\GMDX if you so choose.
