English
French
German
Russian
Spanish


_ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE_
-------------------------

-Human NPCs now sometimes lay down suppressive fire.
-Human NPCs in combat sometimes strafe around corners already facing the player. This is quite the significant improvement to how NPCs move around the world, and how believable and competent they are in combat.
-AI are no longer "psychic" and will not know your location when fighting with other NPCs, unless they have actually spotted you.
-AI will now investigate the source of alarms emitting from alarm units (Previously they'd only investigate alarms from laser triggers and cameras).
-Spiderbots can walk on the ceiling. 
-The range at which a stealth takedown counts is increased by 33% - if you're behind an unaware NPC and aim for the right part, you WILL perform a takedown now.
-NPC grenade throwing is now significantly more versatile, including throwing grenades into vents.
-Hostile AI attempting to move to a location will immediately stop and attack if they bump into the player, rather than attempting to move around him to get to that location. 
-Added minor diversity to what an NPC decides to do after triggering an alarm. 
-NPCs in combat that are moving to a location and see the player often will immediately stop and shoot, rather than continuing running to that location without opening fire.
-Reduced the radius of NPC pain screams, resulting in leniency when attempting to silently take out enemies without the whole area becoming alert. Vanilla the radius happened to be just a touch too loud.
-Animals can now be knocked unconscious.
-Improved various strafing-related behaviour.
-New AI feature: human AI sometimes wander the area after giving up looking for the player post-combat, instead of returning to patrols.
-NPCs will often backup when opening doors, even if it's a non-encroaching door type. (hinders AI door exploitation), and the backup animation should no longer sometimes bug out.
-Improved behaviour related to NPCs opening doors in combat.
-Robots ram down doors blocking their path.
-Heavy robots destroy decorative objects blocking their path.
-AI are somewhat less accurate if the player is moving at high velocities.
-AI with assault rifles are highly innaccurate while dying mid-burst fire.
-Enemies set on fire no longer run into walls if they can't find water.
-Enemies that are melee-based and can't reach the player will run away and hide (e.g player is on ladder, Karkian cannot reach so will go hide).
-Unconscious NPCs now have their name displayed when highlighted.
-NPCs no longer break open footlockers by running into them.
-if the player is blocking the path of an alarm unit an NPC is attempting to get to and press, the NPC will instead attack, if equipped with a weapon.
-AI stealth-related stats have been nerfed a little on realistic mode. 
-The advanced security bot now uses a new/previously unused model.
-Greatly diversified how an NPC behaves when seeking the source of a disturbance.
-Minor improvement to the new NPC melee attack/gun bash system.
-If an NPC runs into glass in combat they will stop and shoot it rather than steamrolling right through it.
-Enabled some overlooked NPC vocal reactions to the player clowning around (like throwing a basketball at them).
-Security camera FOV is higher on hardcore mode.
-NPCs will still be able to shoot you if you're in view but standing behind a invincible or high dam threshold object.
-Advanced security bots can climb stairs.
-NPCs crouch less and strafe around corners a touch more frequently.
-NPCs melee attack gun bash slightly less often.
-If you're hiding behind an explosive object the NPC will shoot it, if it's reasonably far away
-Refined v8.0 helmet bullet deflection behavior. Mechanic NPC hardhats also now provide minor protection, and are likely to break.
-Breaking boxes alerts AI at a lower radius.
-NPC leg pain animation rate is slowed down a touch, to add realistic diversity and tactical advantage to shooting the legs.
-Spiderbot movement animation rate is increased a touch, giving them a more realistic-looking stride.
-Heavy EMP damage now disables Anna, Gunther and Walton Simon's augmentations.
-Grays suffer flamed damage, but do not set on fire.
-Greasel attack rate now scales based on difficulty mode.
-MJ12 Elite are now only immune to tear gas on hardcore mode. 
-Snipers now take their time to fire on all except hardcore mode. 
-Walker bots suffering critical levels of health attempt to suicide self-destruct near the player if specific conditions are met (Hardcore mode only).
-Military bots that have spotted the player take faster strides/move faster, returning to normal when no longer in combat (Hardcore mode only).
-The advanced patrol bot met later in the game now reacts to sound disturbances (Hardcore mode only).

-----------------------------

-You can now jump from ladders.

-Mantling has been improved considerably. 
-You can now zoom in/out with the binoculars.
-You can now mantle low-standing objects if both legs are crippled.
-Right clicking while looking through a weapon's scope will stop looking through the scope as opposed to holstering weapon.
-When throwing objects with a normal right click throw, throw accuracy is precise (vanilla had very noticable randomization, resulting in it being difficult to get a basketball in the hoop for example). 
-The GEP Gun's remote controlled rocket steering is no longer inverted on the Y axis & pressing the left mouse button will boost the remote rocket.
-With nothing in hand, left clicking on doors will put either a lockpick or nanokey ring in your hand.
