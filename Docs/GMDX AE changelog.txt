- Updated a few default settings.

1.1:

New Features:
- Items can now be dropped by dragging them off the inventory grid. This feature can be disabled in the QoL menu.
- Using actions while hacking (such as clicking on turrets, cameras, etc) will now drain hack time. Using Worm softwares will prevent this. This can be disabled in the Gameplay menu.

  - Finding them all will unlock a unique outfit! (Augmentique required)
- The message log will now appear while a DataLink is playing. Added a new QoL setting to disable this.
- Added a small blue glow to Datacubes

- "Double Click Unholstering" setting split out into 2 separate settings, one for holstering, one for unholstering
  - The unholstering setting now allows not unholstering at all, if desired.
- Stealth Rework. Stealth is currently far too easy, even on Untrained stealth you can creep up behind anyone for an easy takedown. To remedy this:
  - Sounds will now propagate more accurately, making sound management and weapon noise significantly more important.
  - Crouching now makes footsteps. Volume is determined by Stealth skill, with Master stealth being completely silent
  - Weapon sound ranges are much larger, as well as the sound radius of all explosions
  - Scopes, Silencers and Lasers now provide drawbacks when attached (Disabled by default, always enabled on Hardcore mode)
    - Addons can be attached/removed from the Inventory screen, or through a keybinding.
    - Attachments are always associated with a specific weapon. You cannot remove a scope and attach it to a new weapon, for instance.
    - Added a new "Wetwork" perk (requires Stealth: MASTER) that will negate all drawbacks from attachments.
    - The "Wetwork" perk is hidden/unavailable when the feature is disabled.
  - The Stealth Pistol and Crossbow are completely silent by default
  - Enemies that notice you while being snuck up on can now react instantly on Hardcore mode, rather than faffing around for a few seconds.
  - Enemies can eventually hear your footsteps when sneaking up on them, but it takes a while (6+ steps usually).
  - Damage from attacks from behind now scale with your Stealth level (3x/6x/9x/12x) rather than being a flat 12x bonus.
    - Attacks from behind now require targets to be in a non-alert state.
- Increased energy drain when throwing objects with the Muscle augmentation.
- The Vision Enhancement augmentation now gives all effects (including sonar) at level 1. Additional levels reduce power drain and increase range.
- Slightly increased energy drain of the ADS and Environmental Resist augmentations.
- Updated the HUD for Cameras and Turrets which are disabled by computers to properly show as Bypassed.
- Added a new gameplay setting to enable or disable using Pepper Spray on laser tripwires. Originally this was a Hardcore mode check only. Still always prevented on Hardcore.
- Increased default Auto Turret damage. Turrets will now deal double damage against enemies, which should help them feeling useless/underpowered in the late-game.
- The ability to rearm grenades based on skill is now a Gameplay option. When disabled, all grenades can always be rearmed as in Vanilla. Updated the log message to be more clear.
- The DTS requiring energy to function and recharging using Biocells is now a Gameplay option. When disabled, the DTS will have unlimited charge, as in vanilla.
- Added a new setting to use the classic Deus Ex weapon sounds, rather than the ones added in GMDX.

- Added a new Demolitions perk "Remote Detonation", which allows detonating placed wall mines with the change-ammo key.
- Robots will now only respond to sounds on Hardcore+, this is to further differentiate them from other enemy types.
- The PS20 now has the same accuracy values as the 10mm pistol, rather than being 100% accurate.
- Added a new "Permanent Cloaking" modifier, which will make Elites and other cloaked enemies always appear cloaked, for extra challenge.
- Tech Goggles (and the Vision Aug) can now see pickups through walls at very short range. This is designed to make Tech Goggles remain useful when not upgraded.
    - Tech Goggles can additionally see Security Devices (Cameras, Turrets, Alarm panels, etc) at short range through walls.
- The Hacking Window now shows the number of Nuke Viruses remaining.
- Added blue text for the Total Ammo count on the HUD when using a weapon that has max ammo.
- The ammo icons in the Inventory screen (used for switching ammo types for a given weapon) now show the max ammo count as well as the total.
- It's now possible to do a small jump while crippled.
- Rockets now detonate after 5 seconds of flight. Range mods increase the flight time by 1 second each. This was actually implemented in 1.0 but was broken.
- Rockets have been made slightly rarer (3 per ammo box instead of 4, 2 on Hardcore).

- Added support for the Visible Attachments mod, which is now included in GMDX:AE by default. The models can be toggled through the HDTP Menu.
- When highlighting nanokeys, their proper names will now be displayed, rather than "Nano Key"
- The Special Options screen on computers will now show an Email/Security button instead of the Logout button, to prevent accidentally logging out without disabling cameras etc.
  - This can be disabled in the QoL menu.
- General Looting Improvements:
  - The Items Received window will now show a running total of items found as you loot multiple corpses in quick succession, rather than being cleared between each one.
  - This can be reverted to how it was in GMDX:AE 1.0 (and vanilla) by using the QoL menu.
- Third Person Conversation Improvements:
  - Items given will now appear next to items received.
  - Credit transfers will also be shown in the given/received windows.
  - Items that were "missed" (such as buying 4 LAMs but only having space for 3) will now show as darkened versions in the Received Items window.
    - Additionally, missed items will now be dropped at the players feet.
  - Both of these options can be disabled in the QoL menu.
- Highlight Window Overhaul:
  - When highlighting a door, computer or keypad which you have the key/code for, the border will be green (non-hardcore only)
  - When higlighting Newspapers, DataCubes and Books, the title will be shown if the item has been previously read.
  - When highlighing a Carcass, the border will change to blue.

  - When highlighitng a weapon or ammo, the border will change to Blue if it can be partially looted, and Red if it cannot be looted at all.

- Nanokeys now display their full name when highlighted, rather than "NanoKey"

- Fixed a GMDX/vanilla issue where conversations with multiple actors would erroneously start if one actor was far away and the other one tried to talk to you

- Augmentique settings can now be configured in the GMDX Menus
- Added a small stamina cost for repeatedly dropping objects with right-click.
- The mod now installs components into the `/Mods` subfolder, which should make your game folder neater.

- When using debris persistence, broken movers will now have much smaller fragments, to allow better visibility of nearby items.

    - Now, the random items from crates are rolled before the crate randomisation kicks in, and can be replaced with other objects of the same type afterwards if Crate Randomisation is enabled.
    - Without Crate Randomisation, the only real change is that crate contents are rolled on map start, not when breaking, so they can no longer be savescummed.
- Reduced the number of added PS20s per map from 2 to 1

- The Lockpicking and Electronics skills have been made more expensive (from 5250->6000 each)
