GMDX Credits:

This version of the mod is based on GMDX vRSD, which was forked from GMDX v9.

GMDX was created by TT aka Totalitarian aka Ash.
GMDX vRSD was created by RoSoDude (https://rosodudemods.wordpress.com/)

This fork is possible thanks to the following awesome people:

- Sarge - Programmer, Project Lead
- Lady Trash - Programmer
- Xriborg - Sound Design, all LDDP content
- LupusDraconis - Perk Icons and other graphical assets

This mod would not have been possible without these testers:
Julian, Georg, the1truepickaxe, Xriborg, domitomi and many others.

Special thanks to the Revision Framerowk team for some small code snippets
which were used as inspiration for fixing the HUD aspect ratio for cinematics,
which previously didn't show subtitles.
