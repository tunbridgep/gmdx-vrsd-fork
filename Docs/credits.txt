GMDX: Augmented Edition Credits:

This version of the mod is based on GMDX vRSD, which was forked from GMDX v9.

GMDX v9 was created by TT aka Totalitarian aka CyberP aka Ash.
GMDX vRSD was created by RoSoDude (https://rosodudemods.wordpress.com/)

This fork is possible thanks to the following awesome people:

- Lady Trash - Programmer.
- Solomon Ichi - Programmer.
- RoSoDude - Game Design advice and some programming help.
- Xriborg - Sound Design, all LDDP content.
- LupusDraconis - Perk Icons and other graphical assets, female JC voices and other LDDP work.
- Adman32 - Art and some weapon sounds.
- Maciek - Trailer.
- Made In China - LDDP+ConFix Conversation files, various art assets and icons.
- Joe Wintergreen (https://www.joewintergreen.com/) - for help with the Lip Synch and Blinking issue.
- Sebastian Kaufel (Hanfling) - for the awesome RenderExt and Editor patch, which fixed a lot of rendering-related crashes.
- cappucciNO - for the vanilla weapon models with attachments
- WCCC - for the masked GM_Trench model, left-hand models, and other help/support.
- Diva - for the masked models (except GM_Trench)

This mod would not have been possible without these testers:
Julian, Georg, the1truepickaxe, Xriborg, domitomi, the1truepickaxe, Made In China,
RoSoDude, Solomon Ichi, ShadowDancer, BennyTheFearless, Tony Swan and many others.

Special thanks to the Revision Framerowk team for some small code snippets
which were used as inspiration for fixing the HUD aspect ratio for cinematics,
which previously didn't show subtitles.

The GMDX:AE Installer comes with the DirectX 9 renderer by cwdohnal, and the DirextX 10 Renderer by Marijn Kentie:
