Sarge's Changes since Beta 2.2:

- Moved DeusEx.Int to the mod's System folder, so as to not overwrite any vanilla files. The int file will be handled automatically when using Kentie's Deus Exe.
- Numerous Bug Fixes
    - Fixed GMDX bug where Intro Cinematic didn't have subtitles bars, and fixed all cinematics to have a FOV of 75, making them always look accurate to the original game.
    - Fixed a bug where the Nuke and Worm software buttons were completely white squares on the Hacking menu.
    - Fixed GMDX vRSD bug where you could pick up and carry heavy objects while out of energy with the Muscle Augmentation
    - Fixed GMDX vRSD bug allowing using Tech Goggles in the secondary slot for half a second or so when out of charge
    - Fixed the Crosshair Visibility settings in the options getting constantly overridden by lasers etc. The outer crosshairs showing your accuracy are also now linked to the Crosshair visibility setting.
    - Fixed GMDX Bug where EMP'd turrets and cameras will re-enable themselves after the EMP effect runs out, even if they were disabled during the EMP effect.
    - Fixed various issues relating to Crouching, including "standing up" when starting dialogue, female JC using regular footstep sounds while crouched (if using LDDP), and other phantom footstep sounds.
    - Fixed GMDX/Vanilla issue where you could retain your standing accuracy bonus after moving if you stood still for a long time. Now accuracy decreases immediately.
    - Fixed GMDX/Vanilla issue where Environmental Training items would have the same durations at Trained and Advanved due to rounding.
    - Fixed GMDX/Vanilla issue where Darts would display a damage of 20 instead of 18, which is their actual damage.
    - Fixed vRSD bug (feature?) where the player would not cough after using cigarettes if the addiction system was enabled.
    - Fixed Vanilla bug where picking up ammo would add it to the players current clip, rather than their reserve ammo.
    - Fixed GMDX Ammo duplication glitch when looting corpses while having a full inventory.
    - Fixed GMDX Ammo duplication glitch when looting and then gibbing corpses, which would refill their weapon.
    - Fixed GMDX bug where some items would have empty name strings.
    - Fixed GMDX bug where Ford Schick would not give you an upgrade canister when telling you he swiped one, if ConFix isn't installed. Fixed by adding it to his desk.
    - Fixed a number of typos in various places.
    - Fixed Vanilla bug where sound volume would reset upon new game.
    - Fixed vRSD "Meat Shotgun" and other HDTP->Vanilla weapon switching madness.
    - Fixed single-use weapon weirdness, such as picking up a PS20 with no rounds in it after it was dropped and then all rounds fired from a second PS20.
    - Fixed GMDX bug where tiredness effects from low stamina would reset prematurely.
    - Fixed vanilla "bug" where diving into or leaving water would give free stamina.
    - Fixed GMDX quickloading not always working correctly, and other save issues including incorrect save-game ordering in the save/load screens.
    - Fixed Vanilla bug where the spy drone would be deployable inside a wall, which would make it fail to spawn but keep the augmentation running.
    - Fixed GMDX "Create Custom Theme" menu being able to corrupt standard themes. Now the player is forced into the Custom HUD/Menu themes upon loading the custom theme creator.
    - Fixed GMDX bug which would make an empty subtitles box appear when interacting with things during first-person conversations, if subtitles were disabled.
    - Fixed GMDX bug where recharging items with biocells would cause the belt view in the inventory to continually get brighter and brighter until the inventory screen was closed.
    - Fixed many other GMDX and Vanilla bugs.
    - Fixed GMDX bug where most inventory items with multiple skins (such as sodacans) weren't showing their skinned variants when being held in the players hands.
- Quality of Life Improvements:
    - Datacubes will show a black screen after they have been read.
    - Added the option to use the original HUD fonts instead of the GMDX ones.
    - The augmentation "hum" sound can be disabled.
    - Augmentations now show their active colours in the medbot interface.
    - Complete overhaul of the "Decline Knives" system
        - "Decline Knives" setting has been removed
        - A new Decline button has been added to items in the inventory. Clicking it will decline a specific item going forward, preventing it from being taken off corpses.
        - The decline list is stored globally and consistent between playthroughs.
        - Items can be removed from the decline list in the inventory screen.
        - Declined Items need to be double-clicked in order to be picked up in the world.
        - Holding the Walk/Run key while interacting will always pick up any declined items.
    - Datacubes will show a black screen after they have been read.
    - When picking up duplicate Nanokeys, the log now lists it as a duplicate.
    - While having a grenade selected, the crosshair will turn blue when you're able to place it on a wall.
    - Right-Clicking while dead will load the last save game.
    - Right-Clicking an item in the belt with the Inventory Window open will clear the slot.
    - Added QoL settings to not damage domesticated animals and cleaner bots when stepping on them.
    - The Inventory "Show Ammo" display now always shows the total amount of ammo you can carry. Before, it was only visible when "Show Descriptions" was enabled.
    - A lot of inventory item displays have been improved to show more statistics.
    - Added a Lighting Accessibility setting, which removes some strobing and flickering in certain areas on some maps, such as the 'Ton hotel elevator shaft.
    - Added a new corpse searching setting, "Enhanced Looting", which makes the first right-click on a corpse never pick them up, even if empty, so that you can search them reliably without accidentally picking them up.
        - Additionally, the first time a corpse is interacted with, it will show any items which it contains that you cannot pick up (such as duplicate weapons and declined items).
    - Added a new setting to show "[Searched]" text after interacting with corpses once, to differentiate between those which have been searched and which have not.
    - Added a new keybinding to stop the currently playing infolink.
    - Using an Augmentation Upgrade cannister (via right-click or the Use button) will now open the Augmentations screen.
    - Completely overhauled the GMDX settings menu to make it simpler, easier to navigate, and with many more options.
    - Edibles and Drugs can now be assigned as secondary items.
    - Pressing the walk/run key while crouch toggled will now uncrouch.
    - You can no longer waste medkits or biocells when at maximum health/energy
    - The HUD now shows stamina and bioenergy percentages below the bars if enabled.
    - Added alternate weapon offsets to hide many of the visible seams or missing parts of weapon viewmodels.
    - Weapons that don't use ammo (such as melee weapons) no longer show the Ammo element on the HUD.
    - Modified Weapons will appear with a "+" icon on the belt and in the inventory screen to differentiate them from unmodded ones.
    - Augmentation Wheel improvements
        - While in the augmentation screen, use middle-click on an active augmentation to add or remove it from the augmentation wheel.
        - By default all augmentations will appear on the wheel.
        - The "Disable All" button can optionally be removed using the options menu.
        - The augmentation wheel can be changed to work in Quick mode. In Quick mode, releasing the augmentation wheel key will select the currently highlighted augmentation. Use right click to cancel.
    - Added a new setting to always show weapon bloom.
    - Added a new setting to not show weapon bloom when at 100% accuracy, because it can obscure targets.
    - In the Inventory screen, charged items will now show their charge level on their icon. Additionally, belt slots containing charged items will show their charge level.
    - Lockpicks and Multitools will no longer be consumed if you look away from an object you're picking/bypassing. Instead, the action will be cancelled and any progress cancelled.
    - Added an optional "Dynamic Crosshair" mode, which shows a small dot-crosshair when no weapons is equipped, and some items have no crosshairs at all.
        - Also fixed many instances of crosshair weirdness.
    - The hit marker no longer hides the crosshair when it appears.
    - Default Right-Click action (holster/unholster) is no longer blocked by having non-highlighting decorative objects under your crosshair.
    - The Crosshair and Selection Brackets will be hidden when a window or menu is open, as they would previously get in the way of notes and other text.
    - The secondary ammo display for items (when assigned as secondary items) now shows inventory count, rather than always displaying N/A
    - Reloading "One-shot-at-a-time" weapon (shotguns, crossbow, GEP gun) will show the ammo count in the ammo display, rather than `---`, because reloading can be cancelled part way through.
    - "One-shot-at-a-time" weapons now have "RDS" instead of "MAGS" on the ammo HUD.
    - "One-shot-at-a-time" weapons have a different formula for calculating reload speed (RDS/SEC).
    - "One-shot-at-a-time" reload cancelling has been made far more responsive.
    - Added an option to display the total amount of ammo remaining, rather than the number of magazines. Disabled on Hardcore Mode.
    - Different shotgun shells have different textures, and the boxes were reworked to have a different texture for easier identification.
        - Shells also have different sounds when they hit the floor
    - Equipping/Unequipping Environmental Training items gives you a unique sound depending on the item.
    - Pressing the Reload key will no longer reload weapons that have a full clip, unless Trick Reloading is enabled (always enabled on Hardcore).
    - Laser Attachments now re-enable themselves automatically if a weapon is holstered and reselected.
    - Hardcore Mode difficulty selection and Gameplay Settings menu are no longer locked behind completing the game, however they strongly warn against changing them.
    - Double-Click holstering now also works to enable Double Click Unholstering, rather than always unholstering with right-click (with IW toolbelt) or doing nothing (regular Toolbelt)
    - The number of total Lockpicks or Multitools in your inventory is now listed on lockpicking/electronics information windows, allowing you to see how many lockpicks or multitools you have compared to how many are required to bypass a given device or lock.
        - The text is also color coded, showing as yellow when you only just have the amount of tools required, and red if you don't meet the requirement.
        - The Damage Threshold text is also red if the currently selected weapon is not able to beat the damage threshold.
        - If this setting is disabled, lockpicks and multitools will display their total count in the ammo display window, allowing you to easily see how many you have when you don't have them on your belt.
    - Belt Autofilling can now be disabled in the options.
    - Save Points no longer use Autosave slots, which can be easily overridden by accident, and now create fresh hard-saves instead.
    - The Dialog Screen has been significantly improved
        - A display showing your current credits balance has been added to the upper panel of the Conversation window.
        - The number keys can be used to select dialog topics (and numbered labels will appear beside each option).
        - The Dialog Menu can now use the HUD Color theme, rather than always having blue text.
        - Dialog Menu options can be configured in the option screen.
    - The Nano Keyring now tells you which key was used when locking/unlocking a door.
    - Added a new "Left-Click Unholstering" feature, which will equip your last used weapon when left-clicking if there was nothing else to interact with.
    - Complete overhaul of "Left-click frobbing", which happens when left-clicking certain items without an item equipped.
        - Left-Clicking a datacube will pick it up and allow you to carry it.
        - Left-Clicking a breakable box, window or wall will select a melee weapon from your inventory based on a priority list.
            - The priority list is as follows: Chinese Sword, Crowbar, Combat Knife, Baton, Dragon Tooth Sword.
            - If you don't have the weapon or the weapon deals less damage than the breakable object's DT, it'll go to the next one in the priority list.
            - The DT check is disabled on hardcore, so it simply checks the weapon's priority and equips it even if it won't deal enough damage to break the container.
        - Left-Clicking on a door will pull out the Nano Keyring if you have the correct key, otherwise it will pull out a lockpick.
            - This behaviour is disabled in Hardcore mode
            - In Hardcore, Left-Clicking on a door will always pull out a lockpick (or the keyring if the lock is unpickable or you have no lockpicks). Right-clicking will then swap between the keyring and lockpicks.
        - Left-Clicking on a corpse will always pick it up regardless of inventory. Double-Rightclick still works.
    - Right-Clicking with the Keyring equipped will select your last used weapon.
    - The Pedometer can now be viewed in the Health screen when using the Addiction system.
    - Subtitles are now enabled in third-person cutscenes regardless of Subtitles setting, allowing text to show instead of useless black bars while also not displaying in-game barks. This can be disabled using the `bSubtitlesCutscene` option in `DeusEx.ini`
    - Added "Belt Memory". When belt memory is enabled, using the last item in a belt slot will keep a darkened version of the item's icon in the toolbelt
        - Regardless of the Autofill setting, no other items will be added to the item's slot automatically.
        - Regardless of the Autofill setting, all items of the remembered type will be automatically added to the belt slot when picked up.
        - Belt memory can be overridden by manually adding an item to a given belt slot at any time, and can be cleared by right-clicking on a belt slot.
        - Items dropped from the inventory or via the drop key will not be remembered, to allow easily throwing away unwanted junk without affecting the belt.
    - Right-Clicking items in the belt while the inventory screen is open will clear the belt slot.
    - Invisible War Toolbelt improvements and bugfixes
        - Fixed bug where selected icon in the belt was forgotten between game sessions.
        - With Double Click Unholstering enabled, a single-rightclick will unholster a weapon if the selection was changed.
        - Pressing a number key again while its slot is selected will set it as the primary selection.
        - Added "Classic Mode". In Classic Mode, right-clicking while having a belt item selected which is not the primary selection will select the primary selection, similar to GMDX v9.
        - Fixed GMDX bug where you could scroll to empty slots when using the IW toolbelt.
    - "Smart Keyring" support added.
        - When Smart Keyring is enabled, the keyring will no longer occupy belt slot 0, allowing it to be used for regular items.
        - The keyring can be selected using Left-Click Frob on doors.
- Gameplay Changes:
    - Destroyable Movers that aren't set to highlighting will now have 1 HP.
        - This removes ambiguity about whether or not a surface is unbreakable, or just needs more hits to destroy.
        - This only affects 1-2 movers in the entire game.
        - You still need to meet the damage threshold requirements.
    - The Dragons Tooth Sword now requires Biocells to use. It starts with 100% charge, with each attack taking 2% if it hits a target, giving you 50 hits total. Biocells restore 20% (or 30% with the Field Repair perk), giving you an additional 10 (15) hits each.
    - The GEP Gun now has limited range. After 5 seconds of flight, rockets will detonate as they run out of fuel. Each range mod increases flight time by 1 second.
    - Selecting the Mini Crossbow or Sniper Rifle from Paul at the start of the game will give you extra ammo (8 tranq darts or 5 .3006 ammo).
        - Both weapons still come with an Accuracy mod (which was added in vRSD)
    - Putting a scope or a laser sight on the GEP gun now requires the Heavily Tweaked perk (ADVANCED heavy weapons, 100 skill points). The scope and laser sight still provide rocket guidance capabilities.
    - Added a new "Weapon Requirements Matter" Playthrough Modifier. When enabled, most weapons will require a minimum skill investment in order to be used.
    - Demolitions Skill Overhaul
        - Demolitions Skill-based grenade timing rescaled from 0.5, 1.0, 2.5, 7.0 seconds to 0.75, 1.0, 1.5, 2.5 seconds
        - Being able to pick up disarmed grenades is now based on skill level - Trained for Gas Grenades, Advanced for EMP and Scrambler Grenades, Master for LAMs.
        - EMP damage will always permanently disable grenades, making them unable to be reused, regardless of skill level.
    - Reverted GMDX change limiting Assault Rifles, Assault Shotguns and Sawed Off's to 4 damage mods. Now they can have 5 just like everything else.
        - This was done because of integer truncation. In GMDX v9, the 5th upgrade would change their base damage from 4.2 to 4.5, which was pointless as it was rounded to 4 either way.
        - With vRSD partial damage calculations were added, so this is now relevant again.
    - Crowbar has been changed from +5 damage vs breakables to instead having 2x damage against breakables, to scale better with low-tech.
    - Augmentation Changes
        - Augmentations can now be swapped out with the opposite choice when finding duplicate augmentation Canisters.
            - Augmentations that are replaced this way will be reset to level 1.
            - Augmentations cannot be freely replaced with any other augmentation occupying the same slot, it must be the opposite choice from their relevant cannister.
        - Some augmentations have been given a short cooldown on use. The Spy Drone retains it's 30 second cooldown.
            - Augmentations that need to recharge after use (including the Spy Drone) will show a red icon in the Augmentations window while they are recharging.
        - Some augs can now be "toggled".
            - Toggled augs do not consume energy when active, but must "reserve" a portion of your total bioelectrical energy in order to activate.
            - The reserved amount is not restored upon deactivating the augmentation.
            - Reserve Amounts can be increased by Synthetic Heart and reduced by Power Recirculator
        - EUAS
            - At Level 2, EUAS becomes a Toggle augmentation, reserving 5 energy to detect hazards.
            - Swapped Level 2 and 3, because level 2 was arguably better than level 3. Now level 2 detects environmental hazards, level 3 shows visibility on the HUD.
            - Level 2 "Hazard Detection" now detects multiple threats (not just one at random), and can also detect grenades. Only the closest gas cloud will be shown, to reduce clutter.
                - Detection Range also increases at Level 3.
        - Aqualung
            - Is now a Toggle Augmentation, reserving 10 energy to function.
        - Aggressive Defense System:
            - Is now an Automatic Augmentation, draining 5 energy per projectile destroyed.
            - Will no longer display explosives which aren't detonated, so it can't be used to detect placed grenades at long range anymore
                - Will instead continue to display destroyed projectiles on the HUD for a second or so after they are destroyed.
            - Now only beeps as projectiles enter range, to prevent annoying earrape
            - Range increased from 340/480/640/800 to 400/600/800/1000
            - Added Player Damage Reduction for projectiles detonated by ADS. Reduces damage from projectiles by 20%/30%/40%/50%
        - Ballistic Protection (Passive)
            - Is now a Toggle Augmentation, reserving 20 energy to function. The reserved amount is discounted when calculating damage reduction.
        - Combat Speed
            - Is now a Toggle Augmentation, reserving 20 energy to function.
        - Environmental Resist
            - Is now an Automatic Augmentation, draining 20 energy per second when taking environmental damage.
        - Power Recirculator
            - All dynamically-applied energy drain from using Augmentations (such as the energy drain from the Muscle aug) now properly accounts for the bonuses and penalties given from Synthetic Heart and Power Recirculator.
            - Synthetic Heart and Power Recirculator energy use is now combined additively, rather than multiplicatively.
                - This means if the heart gives a 10% penalty and recirculator gives a 30% bonus, you will have a 20% bonus.
        - Spy Drone
            - Energy Use reduced from 90 per minute to 30 per minute, to encourage using it like an actual spy device
                - The drone still retains it's 0 energy use per minute while parked from vRSD
            - The drone's EMP cost has been increased from 3 per blast to 20 per blast, so it's no longer a free bomb
            - The drone can now be spotted by enemies at close range
                - The drone is invisible while parked, and cannot be seen at all at level 4.
            - The drone has been made significantly smaller
            - The drone can now be activated while parked, which will reclaim it, allowing immediate redeployment without needing to wait for the reconstruction time.
            - Saving and Loading the game will no longer destroy any drones in flight.
            - The drone can now be used in full-screen (enabled by default), with the player view being displayed in the picture-in-picture window.
            - The drone will bounce off walls and floors slightly less than before.
            - The players equipped item is no longer unequipped when using the drone.
            - Restored the drone creation sound (was removed in previous GMDX versions).
            - The Picture-in-Picture window has been made slightly bigger.
            - When running out of bioelectrical energy, the Drone will be parked automatically instead of being destroyed.
                - Using the Drone augmentation while at 0 bioelectrical energy can be used to forcibly destroy the drone.
        - Synthetic Heart
            - All dynamically-applied energy drain from using Augmentations (such as the energy drain from the Muscle aug) now properly accounts for the bonuses and penalties given from Synthetic Heart and Power Recirculator.
            - Synthetic Heart and Power Recirculator energy use is now combined additively, rather than multiplicatively.
                - This means if the heart gives a 10% penalty and recirculator gives a 30% bonus, you will have a 20% bonus.
            - Upgrades can now "spill over" when acquiring the Heart augmentation. 
                - In vRSD, acquiring the heart for the first time would upgrade all augs the player currently has. This means any max-level augs miss out on the bonus.
                - Now, any bonuses that would have been given to a fully-upgraded augmentation will "spill over" into other augmentations, allowing them to be upgraded twice.
                - The order in which augmentations is upgraded is pre-set and cannot be changed, starting with the Torso, then the head, the eyes, and then moving to the skin, arms and legs.
        - Targeting
            - The Picture-in-Picture window has been made slightly bigger.
    - Hacking Overhaul
        - Bypassing Turrets now requires Advanced hacking, as in Vanilla.
        - Hacked Cameras and Turrets will "reboot" and become re-enabled again after 2 minutes (plus an additional 2 minutes for each level of the Hacking skill)
        - Hacking a security computer terminal will disable it and show an access denied message instead, similar to ATMs (Optional, always enabled in Hardcore).
            - The number of times a computer can be hacked is based on your Computers skill.
            - Regular computers will never be locked out, so you can read email to your hearts content.
    - Normalized damage from the Plasma Rifle, PS20, the flamethrower, and explosives.
        - Now they will use the same damage multiplier across all limbs, making the damage more reliable against enemies.
        - This also means you will take less damage from plasma and explosives to your torso and head.
    - Charged Objects no longer destroy themselves on use in Hardcore mode.
    - JC can no longer move while interacting with security computers.
    - The rifle's grenade launcher doesn't require reloading to turn on, but you need to reload after each shot. It now works like a different weapon.
    - Increased the sawed off shotgun's pellet count from 8 to 9, and decreased shot speed from 1.3 to 1.2.
    - Rubber shells are now hitscan with a harmless projectile.
    - Restricted Saving is now a Playthrough Modifier and is no longer restricted to Hardcore Mode. It's still enforced in Hardcore Mode.
    - Enemies with flamethrowers now give 5-25 flamethrower ammo as loot instead of 1-5
    - Added No Console Access Playthrough Modifier, which prevents using the console (disallows cheats) while playing.
    - Added No Keypad Cheese Playthrough Modifier (called "Unknown Codes") which prevents using keypads or computer logins without having found them beforehand. Some codes which are hinted but never given are excepted.
    - AI Behaviour Changes
        - Enemies will now have a small delay (usually between 0.1 and 0.6) seconds before firing after losing sight of the player.
            - This has almost no effect on normal gameplay, other than reducing enemies ability to instantly shoot as they strafe around corners, resulting in frustrating one-shots.
            - Enemies can now always fire while strafing (was previously a 90% chance). This makes them slightly more aggressive, but combined with the previous change doesn't make them more frustrating.
    - You now take stamina damage from poison, to encourage better management of your stamina bar and give aqualung/ahtletics an indirect buff in combat.
    - Increased ballistic armor durability loss by double, untrained enviro has the same values.
    - Added Door Locking mechanics
        - You can now lock any door you have the nanokey for, plus any doors you have picked previously if you have the Locksport perk (this is retroactive).
        - Enemies cannot open doors which you have locked (Enemies can still open doors that are initially locked in the map unless you lock them)
    - When using Restricted Saving (and Hardcore Mode), Autosaves are now only created the first time upon entering a new level, or if no save has been performed in the last 15 minutes. This is designed to mitigate save-abuse by crossing between maps.
    - Weapon Mod, Enemy Weapon and Container Randomisation gameplay modifiers now use a table of predetermined random numbers, generated at the start of the game, rather than randomising on map load. This means that you can no longer reroll randomisation for a given map by loading a save before a transition to a new map.
    - Perk System Rework
        - Demolitions Perks:
            - Sensor Overload (NEW ADVANCED): After being manipulated by scrambler grenades, affected robots will reboot over 30 seconds.

            - Blast Padding (NEW ADVANCED): An agent's ballistic vest is fitted with a protective layer that reduces susceptibility to self-damage from explosive and plasma weaponry (-75%).
            - Chameleon (NEW MASTER): An agent modifies thermoptic camo output that enables the user to pass through laser alarms undetected.
            - Thermal Imaging (REWORKED MASTER): An agent modifies tech goggle functionality, implementing short-ranged sonar scanning which enables the user to see potential threats through solid material.

            - Firefighter: Fire Extinguishers will have longer range, last for longer, and will explode in a huge cloud when detonated.
    - Addiction System Rework
        - Alcohol no longer heals for 5 points. Instead, it temporarily gives you 5 torso HP (along with it's usual 5 extra torso Max-HP) while in effect, which is removed afterwards. This health removal cannot kill the player.
        - Alcohol no longer adds to fullness when the addiction system is enabled
        - Zyme no longer removes 10HP if the addiction system is enabled.
- Map Changes:
    - The Laser Sight on Liberty Island is replaced with a Recoil Mod on Hardcore mode
    - A Laser Sight has been added to Smuggler's safe in the first NY visit (replaces a recoil mod)
    - The Silencer in Paul's Apartment, Full-Auto Mod in Tong's Lab, and Laser Sight in Smugglers Safe are all guaranteed to appear even with the weapon mod shuffle turned on.
- Miscellaneous Changes:
    - Right-Clicking on the Nano-Keyring icon in the inventory will select it.
        - This is useful when you have Smart Keyring enabled, and want to select the keyring before reaching a door, such as if it's being watched by a camera.
    - Added a new DataCube to explain cameras not detecting unconscious enemies.
    - The players total kills are now shown in the Health screen, similar to older versions of GMDX. Morality info (pacifist, killer, etc) is not shown.
    - Vending Machines now vend random flavours of chocolate bar and soda. This change is purely visual and doesn't affect gameplay in any way.
    - Hand textures have been ported over from LDDP. This means the first-person weapon textures now have properly coloured hand textures, as well as visible augmentation markings where they align with the third person models.
    - HDTP overhaul
        - HDTP is no longer integrated, it's now an optional addon.
        - When HDTP is installed, most HDTP related objects can be toggled on/off in the HDTP model settings menu
        - Some HDTP assets were copied over where they were absolutely necessary for the mod to function properly, such as a few menu backgrounds, weapon muzzle flashes, and some textures. These are now in RSDCrap.u and don't require HDTP.
        - Added some low-resolution vanilla-styled textures that were missing non-HDTP variants (such as the Taser Darts, Big Top Cigarettes, Softwares, etc.) These items will use their high-resolution variants when enabled in the HDTP menu
        - Added some extra features that were previously only available with HDTP enabled, such as color-coded crossbow darts for the crossbow viewmodel.
        - Changed some textures to different ones to account for their HDTP variants better, such as the glowing areas on Security Cameras, which now have a proper blue variant.
        - Some HDTP features that were removed from GMDX (such as alternate inventory icons) have been re-added.
        - Vanilla Soda Cans are now sealed up, to match their HDTP counterparts.
        - Added an alternative version of the vanilla Security Computer texture, with a black screen. The blue screen on the regular texture "bleeds" through the model and is visible at long range. The blue screen will be shown when using the computer.
    - All Junk Items (soda cans, cigarettes, etc) will now have randomised skins, except for Soy Food which uses special Hong-Kong and non-Hong-Kong specific variants.
    - Added 2 new Cigarettes skins (Holy Smokes and Super 45s) based on in-game billboards (HDTP and non-HDTP variants included).
    - Single-Use weapons (grenades, PS20s, etc) will now drop individually from the inventory screen, similar to pickups, rather than dropping as a single stack.
    - Added an "Alternate Start" option, which skips the first part of the game and starts at the MJ12 Lab. You will start with nothing, so this is extra hardcore.
    - The "You Found:" message when searching corpses has been removed. The actual items are still listed, only the extra message is removed.
    - The Paris Metro Police have been changed to using pistols only (from Assault Shotguns and Assault Rifles), to ensure more 10mm ammo is available in the late game, as well as to reinforce their status as the puppet regime under MJ12.
    - Added a number of new HUD themes, including themes styled around Splinter Cell, NSF, Human Revolution and more. Most themes are based on ones created by GEPGUN, with some modifications.
    - Added several new high-quality sounds in cases where interactions didn't have sounds, or used the same sounds for multiple interactions.
        - Added equip/unequip sounds for the Lockpick, Nanokey and Multitool, which were previously silent.
        - Additionally replaced some sounds with higher quality versions, such as the lockpicking sound.
    - Implemented optional Lay-D Denton support. If installed, Lay-D Denton support will be automatically activated.
        - Added an option to the QoL menu to allow male JC to use female hands, for cosplaying as "goth JC" with nail polish.
        - The Lay-D Denton colour scheme is included and can be selected from the Colors menu.
        - When Lay-D Denton is installed, a new Gameplay Modifier is available, which will add the extra NPC's added by the LDDP mod.
        - Without the Gameplay Modifier, only Chet, Russ and a few other NPC's are added where necessary to maintain immersion and gameplay balance for female characters. These characters do not appear for male JC
